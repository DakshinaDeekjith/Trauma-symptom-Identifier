# ðŸ§  Trauma Symptom Identifier â€“ Machine Learning Project

This project is an AI-driven solution to identify trauma symptoms through voice and text inputs. It also simulates an integrated doctor connection mechanism to assist patients in real-time.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Google Speech-to-Text API (for voice input)
- Flask (for frontend simulation)

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Predicts potential trauma symptoms using ML classification
- Supports both text-based and voice-based symptom inputs
- Connects users to a mock doctor module for assistance

- ## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `trauma_detection_model.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
3. For voice input: Convert to text using Google Speech API
4. Run the prediction cell

---

## ðŸ“Š Outcome
- Early detection of psychological symptoms from structured user input
- Basic end-to-end architecture demonstrating AI in mental health
